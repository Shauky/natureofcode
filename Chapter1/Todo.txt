Todo.txt

*** Note: Building in Sublime text assumes that there is only one 
active build file in each folder. 

For chapter One this means that when building any new file, you might have to uncomment the 'draw(){}' section in the previous file.

To prepare a build file for the active folder. Include these settings universally. Folder structure goes like this. 
  Chapter1
     - Chapter1.pde     //this should be the same name as the folder.

 Inside Chapter1.pde include;

 public void settings() {
  size(640, 240);
  } 


void setup(){
  // randomCounts = new int[20];         //this is for the second file
  // w = new Walker();                   // this one is the walker
   background(255);

 }

Then, you only need to include the draw settings and run in the particular file that you are working on.


For Hangouts session 2 we read the Chapter and implemented the Walker class with more random magic.

Then we went ahead and wrote a random bar generator.

 Read Chapter 1 and implement code.

Notes.

Chapter 1 

   I.2 The Random Walker Class
      Example I.1: Traditional random walk
      Example I.2: Random number distribution
       
        Exercise I.1

		Create a random walker that has a tendency to move down and to the right. (We’ll see the solution to this in the next section.)

   I.3 Probability and Non-Uniform Distributions
   		Exercise I.2

		What is the probability of drawing two aces in a row from a deck of fifty-two cards?

		Exercise I.3

		Create a random walker with dynamic probabilities. For example, can you give it a 50% chance of moving in the direction of the mouse?

	I.4 A Normal Distribution of Random Numbers

		Exercise I.4

		Consider a simulation of paint splatter drawn as a collection of colored dots. Most of the paint clusters around a central location, but some dots do splatter out towards the edges. Can you use a normal distribution of random numbers to generate the locations of the dots? Can you also use a normal distribution of random numbers to generate a color palette?

		Exercise I.5

		A Gaussian random walk is defined as one in which the step size (how far the object moves in a given direction) is generated with a normal distribution. Implement this variation of our random walk.
