##Hi, ##

To follow along with the Nature of Code, it would be great if you could 
read the book Chapter by Chapter and try to implement the Code by yourself.

   You can read The Nature of Code [read NOC](http://natureofcode.com/book/ "Nature of Code") here. 


If you need help, the code for the book is available at

	This was a significant change. 

			public void settings() {
			  size(640, 360);
			}

   There should also be a .pde file (empty in this case) for each chapter based on Chapter name. Code wont build otherwise.
